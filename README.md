# Windows-auditing-mindmap
 
## Project purpose
**Windows auditing mindmap** provides a simplified view of Windows Event logs and auditing capacities that enables defenders to enhance visibility for different purposes:
* Log collection (eg: into a SIEM)
* Threat hunting
* Forensic / DFIR
* Troubleshooting

## Mindmaps
The following mindmaps are currently provided:
* Windows OS auditing baseline
* Windows Server roles auditing (also covers SQL Server and 
Advanced Threat Analytics)
* Active Directory (ADDS) auditing
* Exchange Server auditing (planned)
* Azure (planned)

# Windows OS auditing baseline
This map provides an overview of the native Event logs shipped in Windows OS. They are classified into different categories (network, security, application,...) and their related auditing settings.
